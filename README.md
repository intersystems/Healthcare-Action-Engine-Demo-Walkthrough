# Healthcare Action Engine Demo Walkthrough

This repository is designed to accompany the exercises which are described in [Set Up and Explore a Demo of the Healthcare Action Engine](https://docs.intersystems.com/hslatest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=HSEDSDemo_Intro).

[Set Up and Explore a Demo of the Healthcare Action Engine](https://docs.intersystems.com/hslatest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=HSEDSDemo_Intro) guides you through the deployment of a demo Healthcare Action Engine environment 
and the execution of a series of increasingly advanced [CDS Hooks](https://cds-hooks.org/) interactions with the Healthcare Action Engine using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) as a simulated client application. The 
[Postman Collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collections/collections-overview/) within this repository contains the constituent requests for this interaction. These requests are preconfigured so that you can
easily modify them to work on your system.

For more information about the Healthcare Action Engine, see [Introduction to the Healthcare Action Engine](https://docs.intersystems.com/hslatest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=HSEDSUserGuide_Intro).
